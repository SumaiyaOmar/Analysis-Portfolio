# Retail Sales & Profitability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales transactions from **May to August 2026** to evaluate sales performance, profitability, product performance, category performance, and regional trends.

The objective was to transform raw transaction data into a reliable, management-ready analysis and present the most important findings through an interactive **Power BI executive dashboard**.

The final analysis contains **150 validated transactions** and provides management with a concise view of overall business performance and areas that may require further investigation.

- comparing product and category performance
- evaluating regional performance
- identifying findings relevant to management
- presenting the results through a clear executive dashboard

## 🧹 Data Preparation

The original dataset contained **151 transaction records**.

The data-quality review identified:

- missing salesperson values
- one missing discount value
- one duplicate transaction
- inconsistent text formatting
- one unit price stored as text
- one suspicious product price requiring verification

The issues were reviewed and resolved before analysis.

After cleaning and validation, the final dataset contained:

**150 validated transactions**

Additional analytical fields were created for:

- Gross Sales
- Discount Amount
- Net Sales
- Total Cost
- Profit
- Profit Margin

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. August showed the weakest monthly performance

August recorded approximately **$33,036 in Net Sales** and a **32.1% Profit Margin**, the lowest monthly results during the analyzed period.

The effective discount rate also increased from approximately **4.6% in July to 7.3% in August** while profitability declined.

This does not establish that higher discounting caused the decline, but it identifies an area worth further investigation.

### 2. Higher revenue did not always mean higher profitability

**Peripherals** generated the highest category Net Sales at approximately **$50,952**.

However, **Accessories** achieved a considerably stronger Profit Margin of approximately **46.9%**.

This demonstrates why category performance should be evaluated using both revenue and profitability.

### 3. The highest-selling product had a comparatively lower margin

The **27-inch Monitor** generated the highest product Net Sales at approximately **$44,028**, while its Profit Margin was approximately **26.6%**.

Several products with lower overall sales achieved substantially stronger margins, showing that sales volume alone does not provide a complete picture of product performance.

### 4. Regional performance varied depending on the metric

The **East** region generated the highest Net Sales at approximately **$49,641**.

The **North** generated lower overall sales but achieved a comparatively strong Profit Margin.

This suggests that regional performance should be evaluated using multiple measures rather than revenue alone.

## 🤖 AI Usage

AI tools were integrated throughout the workflow to accelerate parts of **data preparation, analysis, DAX development, validation, and dashboard authoring**.

I remained responsible for directing the analytical objectives, reviewing outputs, resolving data-quality decisions that required context, evaluating the findings, questioning unusual results, and reviewing the final dashboard before completion.

AI was used as an analytical and technical assistant, while **human judgment remained part of the validation and final decision-making process**.
